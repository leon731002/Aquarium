SettingViewController is the launch point for the app.
And If the IP is available, the app will automatically switch to the next page, WebViewController.
I classify the files under the project into four types as below:
  - ViewController: each view used to interact with user.
  - Tools: including third party SDK and other common functions.
  - Models: Data structure.
  - StringTables: text of UI components which are in multi-language.
