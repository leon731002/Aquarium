SettingViewController is the launch point for the app.</BR>
And If the IP which is typed by user is available, the app will automatically switch to the next page, WebViewController. </BR>
In addition, I classify the files which are under the project into four types as below:</BR>
  - ViewController: each view used to interact with user.
  - Tools: including third party SDK and other common functions.
  - Models: Data structure.
  - StringTables: text of UI components which are in multi-language.
</BR>
I manage the third party SDK by CocoaPods, so I think you may need to install it first. 


----
## CocoaPods
  - install cocoapods</BR>
  <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>
